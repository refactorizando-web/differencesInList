# Finding the differences between lists in Java

## Introduction 

In this small project (We only have code in test folder), 
we are going to see different approaches to finding the differences between two lists in Java.

We are going to see six approaches:
* Using List API
* API Stream
* With For
* With While
* Using Google Guava
* Using Apache Commons Library.
